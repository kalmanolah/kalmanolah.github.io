Title: About

Hi, I'm Kalman. I'm a techie from [Antwerp][1], Belgium.

### Me

My defence mechanism of choice is humor.  
I don't like spiders, or any bugs for that matter.  
My music taste is all over the place.  
I'm a bit of a perfectionist.  
My code style is always the best style.  
I hope to one day experience *good* AR/VR.  
I'm not very good at getting anything bluetooth-related to work properly.

### Work

I help save the world from proprietary software and technologies as an Open Source Consultant at [Inuits][2], together with a bunch of amazing people.  
It's like being a superhero, except I get paid in money instead of gratitude.

### Technical

I'm a pretty big fan of all things technical, which has lead to me having a pretty broad skillset despite my age.  
If you feel like checking out what I mean by that, you are welcome to take a look at [my Github page][3].

### Hobbies

When not working, I like to not work. Aside from that, I like to play with my Arduino/Raspberry Pi [projects][4] in the hopes of one day successfully automating my home. I also spend quite a bit of my free time working on [Akurra][5], a sort of game(engine) project/thing, as half of the amateur game development team [Multatronic][6].
