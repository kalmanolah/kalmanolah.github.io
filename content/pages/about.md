Title: About

Hi, I'm Kalman. I'm a techie born and raised in [Antwerp][1], Belgium.
I like making stuff, be it software, games, circuits or even furniture.

### Me

If we perform _a lot_ of cherry-picking, I would describe myself as a
perfectionistic, stubborn person. I dislike bugs, spiders and extreme heat.
I'm also a neat freak. My defence mechanism of choice is humor. &#128517;

### Work

I help save the world from proprietary software as an Open Source Consultant
(read: jack-of-all-trades) at [Inuits][2], together with a bunch of amazing
people. It's like being a superhero, except I also get paid.

### Technical

I like to believe that I'm pretty good in turning unknown unknown into known
unknowns. I generally let the internet take it from there.

I'd also say that my skillset is pretty broad, for lack of a better word.

You are always welcome to take a look at [my Github page][3] or [my LinkedIn profile][4].

### Hobbies

When not working, I like to not work.

I dabble in (home) automation with the Raspberry PI / ESP-8266 / Arduino in
the hope of one day successfully automating my own home.

I spend bits and pieces of my free time creating games as half of the amateur
game development team [Multatronic][5].

I also enjoy playing the noble sport of [kicker][6], in which I have taken up
the title of "The Wall".

Various other things are done by me, but none of them are important enough to
list here.
