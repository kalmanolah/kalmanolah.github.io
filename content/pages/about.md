Title: About

Hi, I'm Kalman. I'm a techie born and raised in [Antwerp][1], Belgium.

### Me

If we perform _a lot_ of cherry-picking, I would describe myself as a
perfectionistic, at times stubborn yet generally easy-going person.

I'm not a big fan of bugs and spiders, which is one of the primary reasons for
me preferring winter over summer.

Being introverted and socially inept by nature, my social circle has turned
out relatively small as a result.

My defence mechanism of choice is humor.

My passion lies in making stuff. My strong point lies in analyzing stuff.

### Work

I help save the world from proprietary software and technologies as an Open
Source Consultant at [Inuits][2], together with a bunch of amazing people.  
It's like being a superhero, except I also get paid.

### Technical

I'm a pretty big fan of all things technical, which has lead to me having a
pretty broad skillset.  
If you feel like checking out what I mean by that, you are always welcome to
take a look at [my Github page][3] or [my LinkedIn profile][4].

### Hobbies

When not working, I like to not work.

I dabble in (home) automation with the Raspberry PI / ESP-8266 / Arduino in
the hope of one day successfully automating my own home.

I spend bits and pieces of my free time creating games as half of the amateur
game development team [Multatronic][5].

I also enjoy playing the noble sport of [kicker][6], in which I have taken up
the title of "The Wall".

Various other things are done by me, but none of them are important enough to
list here.
